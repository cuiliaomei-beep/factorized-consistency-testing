    r"""Compute Binary Cross Entropy between the target and input probabilities.

    See :class:`~torch.nn.BCELoss` for details.

    Args:
        input: Tensor of arbitrary shape as probabilities.
        target: Tensor of the same shape as input with values between 0 and 1.
        weight (Tensor, optional): a manual rescaling weight
                if provided it's repeated to match input tensor shape
        size_average (bool, optional): Deprecated (see :attr:`reduction`).
        reduce (bool, optional): Deprecated (see :attr:`reduction`).
        reduction (str, optional): Specifies the reduction to apply to the output:
            ``'none'`` | ``'mean'`` | ``'sum'``. ``'none'``: no reduction will be applied,
            ``'mean'``: the sum of the output will be divided by the number of
            elements in the output, ``'sum'``: the output will be summed. Note: :attr:`size_average`
            and :attr:`reduce` are in the process of being deprecated, and in the meantime,
            specifying either of those two args will override :attr:`reduction`. Default: ``'mean'``

    Examples::

        >>> input = torch.randn(3, 2, requires_grad=True)
        >>> target = torch.rand(3, 2, requires_grad=False)
        >>> loss = F.binary_cross_entropy(torch.sigmoid(input), target)
        >>> loss.backward()
